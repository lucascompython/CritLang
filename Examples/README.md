So [here](sieve.crit) is and implemantation of the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes).
You can see that I start off by filling the array with an `until` loop and then I just use come of the standart functions to do the rest.  
If you run the sieve you would get something like this:

```pwsh
crit sieve.crit

# output

Found 2762 and 22238 composites in 25000 numbers!  Time: 0.5 seconds
```
